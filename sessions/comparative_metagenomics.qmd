Normalization methods, alpha & beta diversity, and differentially abundant features
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this practical session, we aim to demonstrate how the MGnifyR tool can be used to fetch data and metadata of a MGnify metagenomic analysis. Then we show diversity metrics calculus and two methods to identify differentially abundant features using taxonomic and functional profiles generated through the MGnify v5.0 pipeline for metagenomic assemblies, as shown in the workflow schema below.

The dataset is the TARA ocean metagenomic study (WMS) corresponding to size fractions for prokaryotes [MGYS00002008](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/studies/MGYS00002008#overview). Find more information about the [TARA Ocean Project](https://fondationtaraocean.org/en/expedition/tara-oceans/).

:::

[MGnifyR](https://rdrr.io/github/beadyallen/MGnifyR/f/doc/MGnifyR.Rmd) is a library that provides a set of tools for easily accessing and processing MGnify data in R, making queries to MGnify databases through the MGnify API. The benefits of MGnifyR are that data can either be fetched in TSV format or be directly combined in a phyloseq object to run an analysis in a custom workflow.

The exercises are organized into 5 main sections:

1. Fetching data and preprocessing
2. Normalization, alpha diversity indices and taxonomic profiles visualization
3. Comparative metagenomics at community level: Beta diversity
4. Detection of differentially abundant taxa (SIAMCAT)
5. Detection of differentially abundant functions (Aldex2)


Open the Jupyther Notebook
--------------------------

The practice has been prepared in a Jupyter Notebook available in the [MGnify Notebooks Github repo](https://github.com/EBI-Metagenomics/notebooks).

::: {.callout-step .callout-tip}
# To access the notebook open a terminal and run the following commands:
```bash
cd ~/mgnify-notebooks
task edit-notebooks
```
:::

::: {.callout-step .callout-tip}
# Find and open the 'comparative_practice_2023' notebook in the 'R examples' directory 
:::

::: {.callout-note}
# The notebook has colored boxes to indicate relevant steps in the analysis or to introduce material for discussion
Yellow boxes:
	* Up to you: To re-run the analysis changing parameters
	* Questions: For open discussion

Blue boxes:
	* Notes: Informative boxes about the running command
	* Tips: Information useful for results interpretation

# To leave the notebook, you can save the changes and close the window in the browser. Then, terminate the process at the terminal:
```bash
CTRL+C
```
